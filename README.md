ðŸ‘‹ Hello everyone, my name is Simone, and Iâ€™m a **26-year-old Italian Software Engineer** specializing in **cloud infrastructure, DevOps, and security-focused microservices architectures**.

ðŸš€ Currently, I work in the **defense sector** as a **Cloud Engineer** for the **Global Combat Air Programme (GCAP)**, where I manage **on-premise OpenStack-based cloud infrastructure** for our development team. My focus is on ensuring a robust **air-gapped environment**, handling offline artifact and Git repositories, designing secure, scalable **microservices architectures**, and developing **CI/CD pipelines**. Additionally, I lead **technical interviews** for our team.

ðŸ“ˆ Beyond defense, I have a strong **passion for finance and software-driven automation**. I collaborated with renowned finance YouTuber **Paolo Coletti**, developing **data-driven stock market analysis content**. This collaboration led to the creation of **TuttoInRegola**, a SaaS platform that automates Italian tax declarations for foreign brokers (e.g., InteractiveBrokers). I was responsible for **architecting and developing the platform**, leveraging **serverless computing** to achieve near-instant tax declarationsâ€”reducing a process that typically takes days to just under **5 seconds**.

ðŸ’» You can find more information about me and my work on my **LinkedIn profile**: [www.linkedin.com/in/nescio98](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nescio98).
